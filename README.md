# React Portfolio


The goal of this portfolio is to provide an updated snapshot of my current professional work and contact utilizing React. Users have the ability to reach my social media channels with the click of an icon, download my resume, send me an email.  The site is primarily constructed of Bootstrap/Custom CSS and is Mobile Responsive, adapting to any screen size by stacking into columns and shrinking.
